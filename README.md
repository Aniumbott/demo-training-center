# Training Center Demo

This is a repo for the training center demo which is a qualification task for the actual project that is proposed by the CERN-HSF in GSoC 2023.

## Goal-1 (Basic)

- [x] Title (name field)
- [x] Description
- [x] A link to the repository.
- [x] A link to its rendered webpage.
- [x] A link to the video playlist (if present)
- [X] Style the website.
## Goal-2 (Filtering)
- [ ] status: stable/beta/alpha dropdown.
- [ ] videos: available or not checkbox.

## Goal-3 (Simple stretch goals)
- [ ] Add a field hero-image to each module and show an image next to the training module (similar to how it’s done on learn.astropy)
- [ ] Add a simple visual cue based on the status of the module (could be an icon, a choice of color, …)
- [ ] Add alt-texts to the filtering menus from the previous list of tasks.

## Goal-4 (Slightly more involved stretch goals)
- [ ] Add a new drop-down menu “Curriculum”
- [ ] Each of the items in the curriculum drop-down corresponds to a list of training modules in a specified order.
- [ ] After selecting one of the curricula from the drop-down, exactly these training modules should be listed.
- [ ] For example, “Software basics” might list exactly the modules from the “Basics” section of our current training center (“The Unix Shell”, “Version controlling with git”, …)
- [ ] Think about how these different curricula could be configured (e.g., with another .yaml file etc.) and implement it.

Let's see How much I can do in 48hrs 🙄.
