## About
This is a repo for the training center demo which is a qualification task for the actual project that is proposed by the CERN-HSF in GSoC 2023.

## Tasks

### Goal-1 (Basic)
- [x] Title (name field)
- [x] Description
- [x] A link to the repository.
- [x] A link to its rendered webpage.
- [x] A link to the video playlist (if present)
- [X] Style the website.

### Goal-2 (Filtering)
- [x] status: stable/beta/alpha dropdown.
- [x] videos: available or not checkbox.

### Goal-3 (Simple stretch goals)
- [x] Add a field hero-image to each module and show an image next to the training module (similar to how it‚Äôs done on learn.astropy)
- [x] Add a simple visual cue based on the status of the module (could be an icon, a choice of color, ‚Ä¶)
- [x] Add alt-texts to the filtering menus from the previous list of tasks.

### Goal-4 (Slightly more involved stretch goals)
- [x] Add a new drop-down menu ‚ÄúCurriculum‚Äù
- [x] Each of the items in the curriculum drop-down corresponds to a list of training modules in a specified order.
- [x] After selecting one of the curricula from the drop-down, exactly these training modules should be listed.
- [x] For example, ‚ÄúSoftware basics‚Äù might list exactly the modules from the ‚ÄúBasics‚Äù section of our current training center (‚ÄúThe Unix Shell‚Äù, ‚ÄúVersion controlling with git‚Äù, ‚Ä¶)
- [x] Think about how these different curricula could be configured (e.g., with another .yaml file etc.) and implement it.

### Extras ‚ú®
- [x] An input for global search.
- [x] Responssive style.
- [x] No need of a search button all updates on the fly.
